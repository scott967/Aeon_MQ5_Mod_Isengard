This is a MOD of Aeon MQ5 ver 2.0.2 for use in Kodi Helix/ver14
All original authorship remains with Marcos Qui.
Helix MOD uses the Helix updates provided by Kodi from users "Orby" and "lizard".
Update 6.1.2

Install:
unzip the folder service.skin.widgets and skin.aeonmq5.helixmod.zip to a
temporary location.  Start Kodi Helix and in the menu Settings -- Add-ons,
use the "install from zip file" option and browse to the temporary location you
placed skin.aeonmq5.helixmod.zip and select it.  Kodi should begin to install
the required addons, and finally install and enable Aeon MQ 5.  The skin will
be shown as Aeon MQ 5 Helix ver 6.1.2.  With the extrapack addon enabled,
you can download the extrapack files just like in Gotham.

If not previously installed, when you install Aeon MQ5 the addon 
service.skin.widgets will be installed.  This addon provides the recent/in progress/
random and weather widgets on the Home (main) menu window.  To get
the widgets to "playmedia" when you click (select), you must modify the file
addon.xml for the addon (as of Skin widgets ver 0.0.29).   This can be done by 
opening your "userdata" folder (location will vary with the platform you have Kodi 
installed on).  Inside the userdata folder should be a "addons" subfolder, and within 
that (folder) the "service.skin.widgets" subfolder.  Copy the file addon.xml from the
service.skin.widgets folder you unzipped previous and replace the version in
the Kodi userdata.  * Thanks to forum user marcelveldt for the fix for this. 

This MOD includes support for the weather addon "openweathermap extended"
which is available from the xbmc/kodi addon repo.  "weather underground" with user 
provied API key also works as before.

As of 6.1.2, support is provided for the addon script.skin.info.service as a replacement
for script.extendedinfo.  If you have used extendedinfo in previous versions to provide
movie set info in views, you will need to install the new addon (Not yet in Kodi repos, must be downloaded from Kodi forum link.)

Note that various personal tweaks of mine are included.  Mainly an updated set
of strings and some modifications to information shown for "Concerts" (Music
Videos".  There is also support for the pvr.wmc pvr client addon (you can 
create "series" timers).  There's also some fixes from Gotham that were,'t
provided in the final MQ 5 (for example, using the "Group" feature in Smart
Playlists, and some fixes for searching the Live TV EPG).

For Helix Live TV, the Radio channels and playing functionality has not been tested.
The EPG timeline view from Gotham is available, but the new Helix views are
not (now, next, channel), nor is the sort option.

I also have used provided the optional font sets of "large" and "massive" that were 
done by forum user Schumi2004.  I have included my own font replacements that
include support for CJK characters (among others).  If you don't like these you
can simply copy over the font files from the original MQ5 skin package. 

Credit:

Credit goes of course to Marcos Qui for creating this great skin.  Hopefully there
will be an MQ 6 that takes full advantage of Helix.

Forum user Orby completed the basic skin changes incorporated for Helix.

Forum user Lizard-king provided revised Right list view fofr Helix.

Forum user Marceveldt provided the needed edits to skin widgets.

Forum user Schumi2004 provided the new font sets.

Support (such as it is) is in the Kodi user forum "Skin Help and Support"
"Aeon MQ" subforum.
